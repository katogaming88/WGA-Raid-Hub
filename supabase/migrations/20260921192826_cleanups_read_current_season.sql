-- #938, first of four: the two stale-priority cleanups read the current tier.
--
-- add_signup_to_roster() and review_main_swap_request() clear an archived
-- character's standing priority_order rows for the live season, so the old
-- character stops holding a slot in the Priority List, the RCLootCouncil
-- export and the addon panel. Both read the season from
-- team_settings.config ->> 'seasonName' through a '^Midnight Season (\d+)$'
-- regex (20260828124142, and #942 step 5c after it). regexp_replace returns
-- its input unchanged on a miss and null on an absent key, so the cleanup
-- had been skipped for every team with no seasonName (production,
-- 2026-09-21: teams 3 and 4) and would have matched nothing at the next
-- expansion. Decision 13 on #1189 (2026-09-20) made the season app-wide, so
-- the live season is current_season() (#933): the two bodies read it in
-- place of the regex, and nothing else in them changes. Null only on a
-- stack with no tier row, where there is nothing to clear.
--
-- The key itself leaves team_settings in #938's last pull request; until
-- then the site still stamps loot, scores and priority from the team's
-- typed name. On production every team's name is the current tier or
-- absent, so the two readings agree. Same signatures, so a browser on the
-- old bundle is unaffected across the deploy.
