-- Wishlist ranking integration (#515, final piece).
--
-- generate_priority_order()'s candidate pool has been bis_items-only since
-- it shipped (20260710130000_priority_generator.sql): a player only shows
-- up as a suggested recipient if the officer already put p_item_id in their
-- bis_items grid. This adds the raider's own item_preferences tag for that
-- same item as a second, additive signal:
--
--   1. Raider tagged this exact item themselves -> use their tier's
--      multiplier (BiS 1.0/unchanged, Good 0.90, OK 0.60, Catalyst Only
--      0.75), and they're a candidate even without a bis_items row --
--      that's the actual point of letting raiders surface sidegrades the
--      officer's grid doesn't have.
--   2. Raider hasn't tagged it, but it's in the officer's bis_items grid
--      -> multiplier 1.0, exactly today's math, unchanged.
--   3. Raider tagged it 'pass' -> excluded from the suggested order for
--      this item entirely, even if they're still in bis_items -- an
--      explicit "don't give me this" overrides the officer's older pick.
--   4. Neither -> not a candidate, same as today.
--
-- Catalyst Only gets its own fixed weight rather than being conditional on
-- "is this item catalyst-eligible" (the issue's original wording) -- that
-- concept doesn't exist in the schema, and the mechanic itself (catalyzing
-- preserving an item's own stats/cantrip) is only confirmed for the
-- upcoming tier, not guaranteed to hold beyond it. Keeping it as a single
-- number here means retuning it later (if eligibility ever needs to matter
-- again) is a one-line change, not a re-add of the status.
