-- #480: build_rclc_export() exported whatever priority_order last had saved,
-- with no awarded-item filtering of its own. generate_priority_order()
-- already excludes a recipient at generation time (a Mythic rclc_loot row
-- drops them from both tracks; a Heroic row drops them from the Heroic
-- track only), but that only takes effect the next time an officer clicks
-- Suggest Order + Save for that specific item. Nothing stopped the export
-- from re-shipping a stale rank for an item nobody re-generated since it
-- last dropped -- the addon then shows that stale rank instead of
-- "Awarded", because the addon's own award tracking resets to empty on
-- every /rcpl import (RCPL_Data_SaveImportedData in that repo).
--
-- Fix: apply the same rclc_loot-based exclusion at export time, so the
-- export is self-correcting regardless of whether that item's priority_order
-- row is current. Only the ranked `priority` object is filtered here -- the
-- `bis` player-fallback list has the same gap and always has, but the issue
-- flagged that as a separate, lower-priority call, not in scope for this fix.
