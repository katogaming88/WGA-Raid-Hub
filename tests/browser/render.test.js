// This exists because a clean axe report on a blank page is indistinguishable
// from a clean axe report on a correct one, and this project has shipped the
// blank version three times (the guild.html#boe deep link, the #790 stream
// truncation, and #811, which this suite found). Every state here has to reach
// a selector that only appears after its heavy reads land, make no request
// nobody planned for, and throw nothing.
//
// It runs before a11y.test.js has any meaning, so keep it passing first: a
// failure here says the fixtures or the render chain broke, not that the page
// became inaccessible.
