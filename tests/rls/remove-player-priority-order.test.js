// remove_player_priority_order() (20260828022325_remove_player_priority_order.sql):
// removing a player from the roster only ever soft-deleted their players
// row -- their existing priority_order rows for the current season were
// left untouched, so a departed raider kept showing up in the officer
// Priority tab, the RCLootCouncil export, and the addon's Full Priority
// Order panel until every item/track they were ranked on happened to get
// manually re-suggested. This RPC clears them out immediately, scoped to
// the given season only (past seasons are left alone as a historical
// record, same reasoning as rclc_loot/bis_items/attendance).
