// resolve_boe_finder_discord_id (#918): who the sold ping notifies.
//
// The first live sold post missed its finder. The row carried no
// finder_discord_id (it predates #889's stamp) and no player_id, because
// submit_boe_found matches a finder's character within p_team_id only and
// that character sat on another team, removed from its roster a month
// earlier. boe-sold-webhook fell through to the bold name it renders when
// nobody can be found.
//
// This function owns all three resolution steps so the logic can be tested at
// all: nothing in CI parses supabase/functions, so the same code written
// inline in the edge function would ship unexercised. Shape copied from
// resolve_actor_name / resolve_discord_display_name.
//
// The two rules worth stating, because both look like bugs to a later reader:
// removed characters count (the case that prompted this is one), and the
// ambiguity check is on distinct Discord ids rather than on player rows,
// because a person with two character rows pointing at one member is the
// common shape and refusing it would help nobody.
//
// Same withTxn harness as tests/rls/boe.test.js with its own savepoint name:
// the gate cases assert a raise, and without a savepoint per call an expected
// failure aborts the shared transaction and masks the real error.
