// generate_priority_order() avg_existing_rank tiebreaker
// (20260817135343_generate_priority_order_existing_load.sql): Suggest
// Order's re-click fix (js/tabs/tab-priority.js) only ever nudged the #1
// slot away from someone already holding rank 1 elsewhere, and only on a
// manual re-click. Every other rank, and every first click, still ignored
// how much priority a candidate already carries across the rest of the
// priority order -- and nothing ever gave a boost to someone who's
// consistently ranked low (10+) everywhere, since two candidates with
// equally little current stacking just fell back to raw score.
//
// This adds one hard sort tier, avg_existing_rank: each candidate's average
// `rank` across every OTHER item/track they're currently placed on this
// season (excludes the row for the exact item/track being generated).
// Sorted descending with nulls first -- a great average (near 1) sorts
// later here (deprioritized against further stacking), a poor average
// (10+) sorts earlier (boosted), and no placements at all (null) sorts
// earliest of all. Slotted right after tier-piece catch-up and before raw
// performance score, so it only breaks ties among candidates who are
// already equally deserving.
//
