// Officer corrections for self-received decisions (#756):
// delete_self_received_request() plus the revert-to-pending UPDATE path.
//
// Delete is a SECURITY DEFINER RPC because self_received_requests has no
// DELETE policy for any role (the docs/RLS.md write contract). Revert needs
// no RPC at all: the existing "Officers update self_received_requests"
// policy carries a plain status UPDATE, which is why half of this file
// asserts behavior that exists before the migration lands. The delete tests
// also pin the audit entry the RPC writes (action, actor, target, and the
// #377 summary-string detail), and the sync tests pin that reverting an
// approval never unticks bis_items.obtained (the one-way decision in
// 20260725100000) while a later re-approve re-fires the sync.
//
// Uses the shared withTxn from helpers.js, since these tests mix privileged
// fixture writes with impersonated calls and expected raises. Each test opens
// its own transaction, so seed rows (supabase/seed.sql: requests 1 pending,
// 2 approved, 3 rejected on team 1, 4 approved on team 2; bis_items 1 =
// player 1 / item 1 / unobtained) are pristine per test.
