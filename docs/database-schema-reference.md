# Database Schema Reference

A full column-by-column breakdown of every table in the WGA Raid Hub database.
Includes notes on redundancies and why they exist.

> **Where truth lives:** for structure (columns, types, constraints, indexes,
> FKs, ER diagrams), the generated docs in [`dbdoc/`](../dbdoc/README.md) are
> canonical; they are regenerated from the migrations and CI fails when they
> drift. This file is canonical for semantics: what columns mean, why
> redundancies exist, and trigger behavior. RLS policies are documented in
> [RLS.md](RLS.md). Where a column table below disagrees with `dbdoc/`,
> `dbdoc/` is right; fixing the stale text here is welcome but this file is
> not machine-checked.

---

## `season_signups`

Applications submitted by players (or prospective members) to join a raid team for a season.

Lifecycle: `pending` -> `approved` -> `added` (or `rejected` at review). The "Pending Roster" from the old sheet is not a table: it is the set of rows with `status = 'approved'` and `approved_player_id` still NULL, exposed to the officer UI through the `pending_roster` view. No `players` row exists until an officer promotes the signup with `add_signup_to_roster(signup_id, is_trial, archive_player_id)`, which creates (or unarchives) the player, optionally archives a main-swap predecessor, and sets `status = 'added'` plus `approved_player_id` in one transaction. The `season_signups_player_only_when_added` CHECK enforces that only `added` rows link to a player. See [database-decisions.md](database-decisions.md) for why this is a signup state rather than a flag on `players`.

| Column                | Type        | Purpose                                                                          |

| `updated_at`          | timestamptz | Auto-set on every UPDATE via trigger                                             |
| `swap_from_name_realm` | text       | The old character's name-realm for a verified-claim mainswap (`js/signup.js`'s `discordSession.nameRealm` when the typed name differs from the applicant's Discord claim); null for the free-typed "I'm switching mains" case, which has no claim backing it |

---

## `attendance`

Per-player, per-raid-night attendance records.

| Column            | Type | Purpose                                                                       |

| `report_id`       | text | External report identifier (Warcraft Logs report ID)                          |

---

## `player_officer_notes`

Officer-only annotations on a roster slot (#925). One row per `players` row, created on first write.

These were columns on `players` until #925. That table carries a `FOR SELECT USING (true)` policy whose roles are PUBLIC, plus a table-level SELECT grant to both `anon` and `authenticated`, so the notes were readable with the publishable key from the JS bundle and by every signed-in raider. Officers and raiders share the `authenticated` role, so no column privilege could separate them, and a policy cannot hide a column, so the columns moved to a table with its own officer-scoped policy instead.

`m_plus_note` stayed on `players`: the public profile renders it beside the Excluded badge, so it is officer-written but not officer-only.

| Column                   | Type        | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `player_id`              | int4        | PK, FK -> `players.id` ON DELETE CASCADE                                 |
| `team_id`                | int4        | FK -> `teams.id`, guarded against `players.team_id` by trigger           |
| `officer_notes`          | text        | Private officer note, shown only on the officer dashboard                |
| `archived_reason`        | text        | Why the player was removed (#476), fixed vocabulary of six values        |
| `archived_reason_detail` | text        | Required freeform specifics behind that category                         |
| `updated_at`             | timestamptz | Auto-set on every UPDATE via trigger                                     |

Written two ways: the officer note upserts directly from the Roster tab, and `archive_player()` writes the two archive columns alongside `players.archived_at` so a removal cannot record one without the other.

## `team_members`

Links Discord/auth users to a team. The account-level membership layer, separate from the character roster.

| Column         | Type | Purpose                                                                       |

| `config`  | jsonb | Freeform settings (loot rules, scoring weights, display preferences, etc.) |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz | Auto-set on every UPDATE via trigger                            |

## `scoring`

Cached computed scores per player per season. Denormalized for fast UI rendering -- all values are derivable from `attendance` and `rclc_loot`. Unique on `(player_id, season)` so history is preserved across seasons.

| Column              | Type    | Purpose                                                           |

## `player_wcl_season_perf`

WCL character page performance averages per player per season. Written once at the start of a new season by officers triggering a fetch for all current roster players. Never mutated after the initial write. Used as the baseline for heroic priority generation.

| Column            | Type        | Purpose                                                              |

---

## `self_received_requests`

Player-submitted claims that they received a drop (self-reported loot tracking, pending officer approval). Inserts arrive only through `submit_self_received()`/`direct_mark_received()`, and single-row deletes only through `delete_self_received_request()` (#756) -- the table has no INSERT or DELETE policy for any role.

| Column         | Type        | Purpose                                              |

| `track`        | text        | Item track, CHECK values Champion/Hero/Myth -- split from the sheet's Source cell prefix (#322, renamed per #343) |
| `source`       | text        | Where the item came from (Bonus Roll, Great Vault, Crafted, ...) -- the other half of the Source split |
| `note`         | text        | Player note from the request form                    |
| `slot`         | text        | Raw `bis_items.slot` the approval sync targets (#386); null on rows predating it |

---

## `bis_requests`

Player requests to be added to the BiS list for a specific item (officer-approval workflow).

| Column            | Type        | Purpose                                                  |

---

## `mplus_exclusion_requests`

Season-long M+ exemption request queue. Players submit a request when they have no more meaningful gear upgrades available from M+. The durable exemption state lives on `players.m_plus_excluded`; this table is the intake workflow. No season column -- the table is wiped between seasons (by design, not a bug).

| Column          | Type        | Purpose                                                |

## `boe_items`

One row per found Bind-on-Equip, carrying the lifecycle (found -> listed -> sold -> paid, plus retired) and the money receipt once sold. Grant-only writes through the BoE RPCs; no direct INSERT ([#745](https://github.com/katogaming88/WGA-Raid-Hub/issues/745)).

| Column           | Type        | Purpose                                                                 |

---

## `boe_listings`

One row per AH listing event, so relists keep their history instead of collapsing into a lifecycle column ([#745](https://github.com/katogaming88/WGA-Raid-Hub/issues/745)).

| Column        | Type        | Purpose                                    |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `id`          | int4        | PK                                         |
| `team_id`     | int4        | FK -> `teams.id`, must match the item team |
| `boe_item_id` | int4        | FK -> `boe_items.id` (cascade)             |
| `listed_at`   | timestamptz | When it was listed                         |
| `price`       | int8        | Listing price in gold                      |
| `note`        | text        | Free-text note                             |

## `boe_managers`

The standalone grant that gates BoE money mutations, same shape as `guild_officers` and `site_admins` ([#745](https://github.com/katogaming88/WGA-Raid-Hub/issues/745), reshaped guild-wide in [#766](https://github.com/katogaming88/WGA-Raid-Hub/issues/766)). No team column on purpose: BoEs are guild property, so a grantee is authorized on every team's finds.

| Column         | Type        | Purpose                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | int4        | PK                                                          |
| `discord_id`   | text        | Discord snowflake, unique. Known at grant time              |
| `auth_user_id` | uuid        | FK -> `auth.users.id`, nullable. What `is_boe_manager()` matches |
| `created_at`   | timestamptz | Row creation                                                |

Two identity columns for the same reason `site_admins` and `guild_officers` have them: a site admin can grant to someone who has not signed in yet. `auth_user_id` resolves at grant time when that Discord account already exists in `auth.users`, and `link_auth_user_to_member()` fills it on their first login otherwise. A null `auth_user_id` means the grant is not active yet, and `admin_list_boe_managers()` returns the column so the admin UI can say so.

## Triggers

Two shared trigger functions handle cross-cutting DB invariants.

### `set_updated_at()`

A `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on each mutable table. Sets `updated_at = now()` automatically on every write so application code never has to pass it explicitly.

Tables: `players`, `season_signups`, `bis_items`, `scoring`, `mplus_exclusion_requests`, `priority_order`, `team_members`, `team_settings`.

`updated_at` is nullable with no default, on purpose (#272): these tables have no separate created-at column, so the value stays NULL until the first real UPDATE. A row with a NULL `updated_at` is a fresh insert; a non-NULL one has actually been edited. Populating it at insert time would erase that distinction.

### `check_team_id_matches_player()`

A `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE` trigger on every table that carries a denormalized `team_id` alongside a `player_id` FK. Raises an exception if the two disagree -- i.e. if the row's `team_id` does not match `players.team_id` for the given `player_id`. Skips the check when `player_id` is null (allowed on `rclc_loot` after a player is deleted).

Tables: `attendance`, `rclc_loot`, `bis_requests`, `self_received_requests`, `mplus_exclusion_requests`, `priority_order`.

Note: `bis_items` is excluded -- it has no denormalized `team_id` and derives team through `player_id` by design.

---

## Redundancies & Design Notes

### 1. `rclc_loot.boss` vs `item_bosses.boss`

Both store a boss name as free text but serve different purposes. `item_bosses` is a curated static mapping of what boss an item _can_ drop from. `rclc_loot.boss` is the boss recorded _at the moment loot was awarded_ from the addon export -- it is event-level historical data. The loot row captures what actually happened; the item mapping captures current design knowledge. If `item_bosses` were always complete and accurate, `rclc_loot.boss` could theoretically be derived, but it's kept on the loot row for import fidelity.

### 2. `rclc_id` vs `dedupe_key` in `rclc_loot`

Both exist for deduplication on re-import but handle different failure modes. `rclc_id` is the addon's own ID -- reliable when present. `dedupe_key` is a composite hash (player + item + date) we control, acting as a fallback when `rclc_id` is absent or potentially unreliable. Having both makes re-imports robust against either field being malformed.

### 3. `team_id` denormalized across many tables

`attendance`, `rclc_loot`, `self_received_requests`, `bis_requests`, `mplus_exclusion_requests`, `season_signups`, and `priority_order` all carry `team_id` even though `player_id` already implies a team via `players.team_id`. This is intentional denormalization for two reasons: (1) it avoids joining through `players` on every query, and (2) it allows Supabase Row-Level Security policies to filter by team directly on these tables. The tradeoff is that `team_id` could drift out of sync with `players.team_id` if a player is transferred between teams. The `check_team_id_matches_player()` trigger guards against this on write.

### 4. `players.name_realm` vs `team_members.name_realm`

These look like the same field but represent different layers. `players.name_realm` is the roster character (the actual raider). `team_members.name_realm` is the character a Discord account has linked to themselves for identity purposes. A team member's linked character might not match any roster player (e.g. an officer managing from the bench, or a prospective applicant). They will often be the same string but are conceptually distinct.

`team_members.name_realm` is legacy in practice. It came from the #338 import bridge, is read only by `resolve_actor_name()`, and has drifted: two of the nine officer rows in production name a character other than the one the account has claimed. `admin_grant_team_role()` (#910) leaves it null, because setting it buys a nav label and costs a dead "View My Profile" button for any name that is not on the roster. Retiring it or backfilling it is open work.

### 5. `site_admins` vs `team_members` sharing `discord_id` and `auth_user_id`

These fields appear in both tables but are not redundant -- they serve different scopes. `team_members` is team-scoped membership; `site_admins` is a global super-admin check that must work without joining through any team. Keeping them in a separate table also prevents a site admin from implicitly appearing as a member of every team.

### 6. `self_received_requests` vs `bis_requests` -- similar structure, different workflows

These two tables are structurally nearly identical (team_id, player_id, item FK, submitted_at, status) but model two distinct officer workflows:

- `self_received_requests`: "I received a drop -- please mark it obtained on my BiS list." The item FK points to `items`.
- `bis_requests`: "Please change the link for my bis list & update my bis items." The item FK points to `bis_items` (a BiS list entry, not just an item).

They are similar enough that they could be merged with a `type` discriminator, but keeping them separate gives each its own RLS, officer queue, and history without conditional logic.

### 7. `scoring` -- fully derived/cached data

Every column in `scoring` can be computed from `attendance` and `rclc_loot` using the scoring formula. The table exists purely as a write-through cache so leaderboard and roster pages avoid expensive aggregations on every load. The main risk is staleness: if attendance or loot records change without re-running the scoring job, these numbers will drift out of sync with reality.
