# Database Decisions Log

A running record of settled database/schema decisions and the reasoning behind them. Each entry links back to the GitHub issue comment with the full discussion -- this log is a summary and index, not a replacement for that context.

Issues carrying a decision are tagged with the `decision` label: `gh issue list --label decision --state all`.

Each heading's date is the real calendar date the decision was made. It is deliberately **not** taken from the accompanying migration's filename: those timestamps only have to increase monotonically, and have drifted well ahead of real time (the migration written on 2026-07-11 is named `20260726...`). Entries from 2026-07-12 through 2026-07-18 were dated that way by mistake and have been corrected to when they were actually committed.

## 2026-07-11 -- Dropped season_snapshots (#455): designed to replace the season history blob, never actually used

Surfaced while fixing #423 (Danger Zone's Clear Season History op described itself as clearing this table -- it never did). `season_snapshots` (`team_id`, `season`, `snapped_at`, `data jsonb`) was designed in the original migration plan (`docs/supabase-migration-plan.md`) to hold one row per archived season per team, explicitly called out as replacing "the season history blob" from the GAS Script Properties era.

- **What actually shipped instead:** #221 (PR #401) built the real archive/unarchive feature against `team_settings.config.seasonHistory` -- an array inside the general-purpose settings JSON blob -- rather than a `season_snapshots` row. That decision was never written down anywhere; it reads as an oversight, not a reconsideration. The table shipped with correct RLS from day one (team-leader write, per the #294 decision) and stayed accurately documented through several later RLS audits, but nothing in `js/` ever read or wrote it.
- **Verified dead before dropping:** 0 rows on both live teams, zero references anywhere in `js/`, zero foreign keys from any other table. The drop migration re-checks the row count at migration time rather than trusting that to still hold.
- **Not editing `docs/supabase-setup-guide.md`.** Rex owns later phases there per standing practice; this drop is noted for him separately rather than touched into the locked file.
- **Existing decision-log entries mentioning `season_snapshots`** (RLS policy history, e.g. the #413 and #294 entries below) are left as-is -- they're accurate records of decisions made about the table while it existed, not claims that it's still in use.

## 2026-07-11 -- Item catalog slot vocabulary (#453): re-derived from Wowhead, not translated; duplicates deleted, not merged

`items.slot` held a vocabulary hand-typed into the retired GAS "Item Lookup" spreadsheet (`Boots`, `Gloves`, `Belt`, `Bracers`, `Cloak`, `Shoulders`, `Ring`, `1H/2H`, `OH`, `Unknown`). The game, Wowhead, `scripts/fetch-items.js`, and `bis_items.slot` all say `Feet`, `Hands`, `Waist`, `Wrist`, `Back`, `Shoulder`, `Finger`, and split weapons into `One-Hand`/`Two-Hand`/`Ranged` -- so the catalog was the only thing out of step, and every consumer carried a synonym table to bridge it. Surfaced while building #386, where the display slot and `bis_items.slot` diverging nearly shipped a silent no-op.

- **Slots re-derived from Wowhead by `wow_item_id` (the `&xml` endpoint's `<inventorySlot>`), not string-translated from the old words.** A mapping table cannot split `1H/2H` into One-Hand (12 items) / Two-Hand (5) / Ranged (2), and cannot recover `Unknown` (19 items) at all -- together ~30% of the catalog. Every item carries a `wow_item_id`, so the authoritative source was available and guessing was unnecessary.
- **The type-vs-position split is kept, because it is irreducible.** `items.slot` is an equip *type* (a ring fits either finger; Wowhead returns `Finger`, i.e. Blizzard's `InventoryType`), while `bis_items.slot` is a *position* (`Finger 1`). Only the officer's BiS assignment can say which, so `BIS_CATALOG_SLOT_TO_ROWS` still fans `Finger`/`Trinket` out to both numbered rows. This mirrors how the game models it (`INVTYPE_*` vs `INVSLOT_*`) and how the RCLootCouncil addon already does (`INVTYPE_FINGER = { "ring1", "ring2" }`).
- **19 duplicate rows deleted rather than merged, and a unique index added on `wow_item_id`.** The catalog held 132 rows for 113 distinct items -- every tier token existed twice, once hand-filed with a slot and once seeded bare as `Unknown`. They evaded `unique(lower(name))` because the hand-filed rows carry an armor-type suffix (`Alnforged Riftbloom (Plate)`) and the seeded ones do not; nothing enforced uniqueness on `wow_item_id`. Confirmed against the live database that no `bis_items`, `rclc_loot`, `priority_order`, `self_received_requests` or `item_bosses` row referenced a duplicate, and that all 19 survivors kept their boss mapping -- so a delete was safe and a merge unnecessary. The migration guards this rather than trusting it: it raises if any reference exists at run time.
- **Armor type dropped from tier-token names.** `Alnforged Riftbloom (Plate)` -> `Alnforged Riftbloom`; `items.armor_type` already stores `Plate`. The suffix was how the spreadsheet told four identically-named tokens apart, which the column now does. Only a suffix literally repeating `armor_type` is stripped, so `Chiming Void Curio (Tier)` -- a class-set trade token with no armor type -- is left alone. This has to run *after* the dedupe, since the bare names were exactly what the duplicate rows occupied.
- **`Curio` and `Placeholder` map to no BiS row on purpose.** The one Curio is a class-set trade token ("trade this for powerful class set armor"), and the placeholders (M+/Crafted/Catalyst) name a loot source. Neither names a gear position, so neither is exportable as a BiS slot.
- **Noted, not done: keying slots by the game's numeric `InventoryType`/`INVSLOT` id** with a reference table, which would buy FK integrity (`Trinket 3` becomes unstorable) and a natural sort order. Not needed to fix the above -- once the names are normalized they already agree -- so it stays a possible follow-up rather than scope here.

## 2026-07-11 -- Self-received approval syncs bis_items.obtained (#386): a slot column plus a one-way trigger, not RPC-side writes

Approving a self-received item should tick the matching BiS row as obtained, so BiS Manager stays the one place officers actively *edit* a list and "Mark received" is only a received-state signal (#217's stated intent). Three decisions fell out of it.

- **Added `self_received_requests.slot` (nullable text)** rather than matching on `(player_id, item_id)` alone. `bis_items` is unique on `(player_id, item_id, coalesce(slot, ''))`, and the placeholder items -- `M+`, `Crafted`, `Catalyst` (`items.is_placeholder`) -- name a loot *source* rather than a piece of gear, so one player legitimately lists `M+` against six different slots (10 such rows live at the time of writing). An approved `M+` with no slot could not say which of those rows it filled; flipping all of them would fill six slots from one drop. The frontend already knew the answer (the "Mark received" button is rendered per BiS row) and simply had nowhere to put it.
- **The button sends the raw `bis_items.slot`, not the displayed slot name.** These diverge routinely -- the item catalog says `Boots`/`Gloves`/`Trinket` where `bis_items` says `Feet`/`Hands`/`Trinket 1` (and 30 live rows carry a blank BiS slot against a `Trinket` catalog slot). `mapSupabaseBisItems()` already exposed both as `entry.slot` (display) and `entry.dbSlot` (raw), for exactly this reason on the tab-bis.js delete/update path. Sending the display slot would have made the trigger match nothing for most real items -- a silent no-op, not an error.
- **The flip lives in a trigger on `self_received_requests`, not inside `submit_self_received()`/`direct_mark_received()`.** There is a third path to `approved` that is neither RPC: the officer Requests tab (`js/tabs/tab-requests.js`) approves a pending row with a plain `UPDATE`. A trigger catches all three (raider auto-approve, officer direct-mark, queue approval) and cannot be bypassed by a fourth. `SECURITY DEFINER`, since a raider auto-approving their own item is not an officer and writes to `bis_items` are restricted to officers.
- **One-way on purpose**: approving sets `obtained = true`; rejecting or reverting an approval never sets it back to `false`. An officer may have ticked the box by hand for an unrelated reason, and clearing it here would silently discard that. Unticking stays a deliberate officer action in BiS Manager.
- **Both RPCs were dropped and recreated, not `CREATE OR REPLACE`d.** A function is identified by `(name, argument types)`, so adding `p_slot` would have left the old 6-argument version in place as an overload that PostgREST could still resolve calls to.

## 2026-07-10 -- Season-code to display-name mapping (#341): stays a frontend translation, now pattern-derived instead of hardcoded per season

`scoring.season`/`priority_order.season`/`rclc_loot.season` store a compact code (`MID1`, decided on #320) as the stable join/filter key across those tables, while officers see and type a free-text display name (`DATA.seasonName`, Season Settings tab -> `team_settings.config` via `saveTeamSetting()`, #221). Something has to translate between the two on every read/write that touches season data.

- **Kept as a frontend translation in `js/common.js`** (`seasonDisplayName()`/`seasonCodeForDisplay()`), rather than a dedicated `seasons` table or a `settings.config` key -- this was already the de facto mechanism since #209 (a single hardcoded `SEASON_LABELS` entry), just never formally decided.
- **Revised during the same PR from a hardcoded map to a pattern**: the first draft kept `SEASON_LABELS = { MID1: 'Midnight Season 1' }` as the permanent mechanism and documented a runbook ("add the next season's code here before officers start using it") -- flagged as insufficient before merge, since it required remembering a manual step at every season boundary with a silent failure mode if skipped (every `p_season`-resolving write would store the full display string instead of a short code). Replaced with a regex pattern (`'MID' + N` <-> `'Midnight Season ' + N`), so `MID2`, `MID3`, etc. translate automatically the moment they appear, no code change required. `SEASON_LABELS` is now empty by default and survives only as an explicit override for a season that breaks the pattern.
- **Revised again to make the prefixes themselves configurable**: `MID`/`Midnight Season` were still literal strings baked into the regex, so a future expansion (whose codes won't start with `MID`) would still need a code change. Moved them to `team_settings.config.seasonCodePrefix`/`seasonDisplayPrefix`, editable from a new "Season Code Prefix" field in Season Settings, defaulting to today's values when unset so no existing team needs a backfill. Flagged as an interim per-team setting: every team plays the same real-world expansion timeline, so this is really cross-team config that belongs on the site admin dashboard once #232 exists, not something each team's officers could independently drift on -- noted on #232 for when that lands.
- **No `data/seasons.json` involvement**: that file is an optional local input to the one-time legacy-loot-history import script (`scripts/import/generate.js`), not a repo-tracked or deployed artifact -- it doesn't intersect with this live-app translation at all.

## 2026-07-10 -- players.officer_notes (#407): the column #407 assumed already existed had to be added

#407's premise -- "`players.officer_notes` already exists as a column in the schema but is never read or written anywhere in `js/`" -- was wrong. The column that actually exists is `mplus_exclusion_requests.officer_notes` (`initial_schema.sql`), a different table entirely; `dbdoc/public.players.md`'s relations diagram embeds that table's full column list next to `players`' own for the FK diagram, which is what got misread as a `players` column both when the issue was filed and when this fix's own PR first shipped without the column. Confirmed against the live database only after roster loads started failing with `column players.officer_notes does not exist`, well after the frontend write path (`renamePlayer`/`savePlayerNote`) had already been wired to it.

- **Plain `alter table ... add column officer_notes text`, no default, matching `m_plus_note`'s shape** -- an officer free-text field with no structural constraints of its own.
- **No RLS change**: `Officers write players` already grants UPDATE on the whole row to officer/team_leader; a new nullable column needs no new grant.
- **Takeaway for future request-table/column audits**: verify a claimed-existing column against the live database (or at minimum a full-text match on the exact table name in `dbdoc/schema.json`, not a substring/adjacent-context match) before writing the frontend side against it -- `dbdoc/`'s per-table relations diagrams intentionally embed related tables' columns for the ER diagram, which reads identically to that table's own column list at a skim.

## 2026-07-10 -- Self-received request write path (#406): both submit and direct-mark go through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs, auto-approve now checks real Supabase Auth

`self_received_requests` fit the live feature exactly (`track`/`source`/`note` match `submitSelfReceivedRequest`'s payload one-to-one) -- it just never had an INSERT path or any frontend reference, matching #404/#405's finding for the other two request tables.

- **Two new RPCs, both SECURITY DEFINER: `submit_self_received()` (raider, granted to `anon`+`authenticated`) and `direct_mark_received()` (officer, granted to `authenticated` only).** Unlike `submit_bis_link()`/`submit_mplus_exclusion()`, the officer path here also needed a definer function rather than a plain RLS-gated insert -- `tests/rls/write-policies.test.js` already asserts request tables have no INSERT policy for anyone, officers included, so `direct_mark_received()` checks `my_team_role()`/`is_site_admin()` inside the function body instead.
- **Auto-approve now checks `auth.uid()` through `players.team_member_id -> team_members.auth_user_id`, replacing GAS's legacy Discord OAuth session-token check.** #222 already moved login itself onto Supabase Auth (`js/discord.js`'s `getDiscordSession()` wraps a real Supabase Auth session, not a GAS token), so "is the submitting raider signed in as this character" is a straight join instead of a client-supplied token GAS had to independently validate.
- **`DATA.selfReceived` (a player's approved self-received items, used for BiS-completion and profile badges) now reads from Supabase first, falling back to the Apps Script heavy chunk** -- same pattern as `bisList`/`priorityOrder` (#217, #220). Only `approved` rows are pulled; pending/rejected stay officer-queue-only.

## 2026-07-10 -- Site-admin cross-team access on request tables (#413): four tables were missing OR is_site_admin()

While verifying #403's historical Hellfire signup backfill actually landed in production, the officer Signups History tab showed "No signups recorded" despite the data being confirmed correct via direct read-only access. Root cause: `my_team_role(team_id)` resolves per-team from `team_members`, and Kat's own account isn't a `team_members` row on Hellfire's team (a different Discord account holds team_leader there) -- so as far as RLS was concerned, the account had zero role on that team, same as any stranger.

That's expected behavior for a plain officer -- but Kat is also a site admin, and every other officer-scoped table already ORs in `is_site_admin()` so a site admin isn't limited to only the teams where they personally hold a `team_members` role (`audit_log`, `team_members`, `team_settings`, `season_snapshots`). Auditing every "Officers read/update" policy in the schema found four that never got this clause when `initial_schema.sql` created them: `season_signups`, `bis_requests`, `mplus_exclusion_requests`, `self_received_requests` -- all four "request" tables, all predating #403/#404/#405 (those PRs added RPCs/columns to three of them but never touched their read/update policies).

- **Added `OR is_site_admin()` to the read and update policies on all four tables**, matching the existing pattern exactly (`my_team_role(team_id) = ANY (ARRAY['officer','team_leader']) OR is_site_admin()`).
- **Updated `docs/RLS.md`'s per-table matrix and "Known issues" section**, which had also gone stale: it still said the write path for `season_signups`/`bis_requests`/`mplus_exclusion_requests` was "service-role only," true before #403-#405 but superseded once each got a narrow SECURITY DEFINER RPC. Those three PRs never triggered the "update RLS.md" CI check because none of them touched policy SQL -- only this PR's actual policy change did, which is exactly the gap that let the note go stale silently.
- **RLS test coverage added** (`tests/rls/read-matrix.test.js`, `write-policies.test.js`): site admin (a UID with no `team_members` row on either seeded team) can read all four tables and update at least one, proving the fix rather than just the policy text.

## 2026-07-10 -- M+ exclusion write path (#405): approve now sets players.m_plus_excluded directly, rejection state derived live

Unlike `bis_requests` (#404), `mplus_exclusion_requests` already fit the live feature exactly (`reason`/`raiderio_url`/`status` match `submitMPlusExclusion`'s payload one-to-one) -- it just never got an INSERT path or any frontend reference. Confirmed 0 rows in production before writing this.

- **New `submit_mplus_exclusion()` RPC, SECURITY DEFINER, granted to `anon`** -- same trust model as `submit_bis_link()`/`submit_season_signup()`: the form runs unauthenticated on the public roster page. Re-validates `mPlusExclusionsOpen` server-side.
- **Approve now sets `players.m_plus_excluded`/`m_plus_note` directly, in the same officer action as marking the request approved.** GAS decoupled these: `approveMPlusExclusion` only ever updated the request's own status/note, and a _separate_ manual roster toggle (`setMPlusExcluded`, a Script Property array) was the only thing that actually excluded the player from weekly M+ requirements. That meant an approved request could sit approved indefinitely without the player ever actually being excluded, if the officer forgot the second step. Collapsing this into one write matches #404's BiS approve precedent (which also writes `players.bis_link` directly) and closes a real gap rather than just porting GAS's behavior faithfully.
- **`mPlusRejected`/`mPlusRejectionNote` are derived live from the most recent rejected request per player, not new `players` columns.** GAS tracked these via a Script-Property-backed scan of the whole exclusion sheet; `players` has no rejection-state columns, and adding one for what's fundamentally a request-table fact (was the raider's most recent submission turned down) would just duplicate state already in `mplus_exclusion_requests`. `fetchSupabaseMPlusRejections()` (`js/common.js`) queries the latest `rejected` row per `player_id` alongside the roster fetch and merges it in client-side.
- **Bulk "clear all" now just resets `players.m_plus_excluded = false` for the whole team**, with nothing else to reconcile -- GAS's version additionally flipped any `Approved` sheet rows to a `Reset` sentinel status so a later re-scan wouldn't double-count them; that bookkeeping only existed because the sheet itself was the source of truth for exclusion state. Since exclusion now lives solely on `players`, clearing it is the whole operation.

## 2026-07-10 -- bis_requests repurposed for BiS link submissions (#404): dropped bis_req_item_id, gating moved to players.bis_allowed

`bis_requests` existed since `initial_schema.sql` with Officers read/update RLS already in place, but nothing ever wrote to it (confirmed 0 rows, 0 references in `js/`). Its shape -- `bis_req_item_id integer NOT NULL`, an FK to `items` -- couldn't hold what the live raider-facing feature actually submits: a whole BiS list URL (`js/common.js` `submitBiSForm` -> GAS `submitBiS`), one per player, unrelated to any single item. It looks like it was scaffolded generically alongside the other request tables (`self_received_requests`, `mplus_exclusion_requests`) assuming a per-item shape this feature never matched.

- **Repurposed the existing table rather than adding a second one**, since it was empty and unreferenced anywhere: dropped `bis_req_item_id`, added `bis_link text not null` and `player_note text`.
- **New `submit_bis_link()` RPC, SECURITY DEFINER, granted to `anon`** -- the submission form runs unauthenticated on the public roster page, same trust model as the GAS action it replaces. Re-validates the gate server-side (`team_settings.config.bisSubmissionsOpen` team-wide, or the player's own `bis_allowed`) rather than trusting the client's decision to show the form.
- **Per-player submission gating (`allowBisForPlayer`/`revokeBisForPlayer`) moved to a `players.bis_allowed` boolean column, not `team_settings`.** GAS stored this as a Script Property array toggled by any officer, no role distinction. The natural Supabase home for team-wide config, `set_team_setting()` (#221), is gated by "Team leaders write settings" -- routing a per-player toggle through it would have tightened today's any-officer access down to team_leader/site_admin only. A column on `players` keeps it on that table's existing officer-write rule instead (already officer _and_ team_leader), so the toggle stays exactly as accessible as it is today, with no new RPC.
- **Officer approve/reject and manual link edits write `bis_requests`/`players` directly** (two separate calls, not one transaction) -- both tables already have officer-write RLS, matching the direct-write pattern `js/tabs/tab-roster.js` already uses elsewhere. A failure between the two calls just leaves the request pending for a retry, no partial state an officer could act on incorrectly.

## 2026-07-10 -- season_signups write path (#403): SECURITY DEFINER RPC granted to anon, no anti-spam token yet

`season_signups` had no INSERT path of any kind -- only officer read/update -- because the public signup form (`js/signup.js`) still wrote exclusively to the GAS "Roster Responses" Sheet, which the officer Signups/Pending Roster tabs stopped reading when they switched to Supabase-only reads in #328. Every real signup submitted since then landed somewhere no officer screen ever reads.

- **New `submit_season_signup()` RPC, SECURITY DEFINER, granted to `anon` (and `authenticated`)** -- unlike `claim_character()` (#212), which requires `auth.uid()`, this form runs for prospective recruits with no Discord session at all, so `anon` must be able to call it directly. It checks `team_settings.config.signupsOpen` server-side (the form's client-side gate was cosmetic only) and resolves `class_spec_id`/`swap_class_spec_id` from class/spec text itself, forcing `status = 'pending'`. `season_signups` still grants `anon` no direct table INSERT -- this function is the only write path.
- **No anti-spam token for v1.** #328's original out-of-scope note wanted an Edge Function with a spam token; Edge Functions are Phase 7 and don't exist yet. The `signupsOpen` server-side check alone is already strictly tighter than the status quo (GAS's `submitSignup` had no server-side gate at all), so shipping the RPC now without a token is not a regression. A token or the Edge Function replacement can be added later without a breaking change to the form's payload shape.
- **The free-text Discord Name field is dropped from the form**, per the #340 decision: the verified Discord link lives on `team_members` via the Claims flow now, and the typed handle predates that.
- **The GAS `submitSignup` call stays in place, called after the Supabase write succeeds**, solely for its Discord bot notification side effect -- #224 owns moving that notification to an Edge Function. No GAS code changed in this PR.
- **One-time historical backfill**: Hellfire's GAS sheet held ~21 real MID2 signups (Phoenix's sheet only had 2 June test rows, skipped). Cross-referenced against the live `players` table for team 2 to resolve each row's status: already-rostered names became `status = 'added'` with `approved_player_id` set (settled history, not a live queue item); the sheet's one `Denied` row became `rejected`; two names with no roster match and no denial (`Dhbruh-Dalaran`, flagged during the audit that opened #403, and `Poplockndots-Thrall`, found during this backfill) became `status = 'approved'` with `approved_player_id` left null, surfacing them in Pending Roster for an officer to actually decide on rather than leaving them invisible.

## 2026-07-10 -- bis_items.slot (#393): officer-chosen slot for placeholder entries

Placeholder BiS entries (M+, Crafted, Catalyst) were displaying the literal word "Placeholder" as their slot -- `items.slot` is `NOT NULL`, and those rows store that sentinel since they name a loot source, not a gear slot. The old GAS BiS List sheet carried the real slot per-row instead (a player wrote "M+" into whichever slot's row they meant); that context was discarded at the #217/#320 migration, when `bis_items` collapsed to `(player_id, item_id)` with no home for it -- a known, documented, unrecoverable loss (`scripts/import/tables/bis.js`), same acceptance as the audit_log TARGET backfill (#377).

- **Added `bis_items.slot text`, nullable.** Originally scoped to placeholder rows only, but extended same-day once the editor moved to a fixed slot grid (below): "Finger"/"Trinket" alone can't say which of the two numbered rows a _real_ ring or trinket is for either, so every row the editor writes now carries an explicit `slot`, not just placeholder rows. Stays null only for legacy rows written before this column existed.
- **`bis_items_no_dupe_item_key` changed from `UNIQUE (player_id, item_id)` to a `UNIQUE (player_id, item_id, coalesce(slot, ''))` expression index**, so the same item (placeholder or real) can be aimed at two different slots for one player (e.g. both Finger slots at "M+", or two different rings each explicitly slotted). Legacy rows with `slot` still null keep deduping exactly as before, since `coalesce(slot, '')` collapses them all to `''`.
- **Frontend:** the BiS Manager editor became a fixed 16-slot grid (`BIS_SLOTS`, `js/tabs/tab-bis.js`) instead of a flat search-then-add list -- every row an officer fills writes its canonical slot to `bis_items.slot`, and the grid's per-row search is scoped to items whose catalog slot fits that row (`BIS_CATALOG_SLOT_TO_ROWS`), with M+/Crafted/Catalyst placeholders always offered everywhere. Delete/toggle-obtained now filter on `slot` too (`.eq('slot', ...)` / `.is('slot', null)`), since `item_id` alone no longer uniquely targets a row once more than one can share it.

## 2026-07-09 -- Discord Claims display name (#389): new function, not a reuse of resolve_actor_name()

The Roster tab's Discord Claims list only ever showed the raw Discord snowflake id, making it hard for an officer to visually confirm the right account claimed the right character. `resolve_actor_name()` (#376) already resolves an actor uuid to a display name, but for a different purpose (the audit log's CHANGED BY column) with a resolution order that's wrong here: linked-character nickname/name first, Discord display name only as a last resort for a site admin acting cross-team.

- **New `resolve_discord_display_name(p_actor_id uuid, p_team_id integer)` function** instead of adding a mode flag to `resolve_actor_name()`. The claims-verification use case specifically wants the raw Discord display name every time, not the identity resolveAuditName prioritizes -- showing a claimed character's own nickname back as "the Discord name" would defeat the purpose (confirming the human behind the claim, not the character).
- **Same SECURITY DEFINER shape and gate** as `resolve_actor_name()`/`write_audit_log()`: officer/team_leader-or-site-admin on the team, since it's still surfacing `auth.users` PII not exposed to anon/authenticated directly.
- **Resolved client-side per claim, not joined in the query** -- `fetchTeamClaims()` (`js/discord.js`) only calls it for rows with a non-null `auth_user_id` (a pre-listed officer awaiting their first login has none yet), since a SECURITY DEFINER function can't be embedded in a PostgREST select the way a foreign-key join can.

## 2026-07-09 -- RCLC loot import (#219): SECURITY INVOKER RPC, instance-suffix track, boss/itemID read straight off the export

The GAS paste-import only ever carried `id, player, date, itemName, instance` into the "Pasted Loot" sheet -- no difficulty, boss, or item-id derivation existed anywhere in the import path. Migrating this needed real new logic, not a straight port, and a sample live RCLC JSON export (provided by Kat) settled several things the issue itself had flagged as open:

- **Boss is directly in the export** (`"boss":"Chimaerus the Undreamt God"`) -- no `item_bosses` lookup needed at all, despite the issue's implementation steps suggesting one. `item_bosses` is many-to-many (`(item_id, boss)` composite PK, an item can drop from several bosses), so a lookup-based resolution would have been ambiguous anyway; the export already answers the question directly per row.
- **Item resolved by `itemID` (wow_item_id) first, name as fallback** -- the export's `itemID` field matches `items.wow_item_id` unambiguously, more reliable than name matching (special characters, renames). Mirrors the historical import's `itemIdByWowId` pattern for the legacy tracker source.
- **Track derived from the `instance` string's difficulty suffix only** (`"The Dreamrift-Mythic"` -> `Myth`), the same `parseTrack()` logic the one-time historical import already proved out. The export's `itemString` does technically encode the authoritative track via Blizzard bonus IDs, but decoding those needs a maintained bonus-ID reference table this repo doesn't have -- deferred as a documented future enhancement, not attempted now. Confirmed with Kat rather than half-implementing a guess.
- **"Source" is moot** -- `rclc_loot` has no column for it; the concept only applies to a different table (`self_received_requests`). What Kat actually wanted noted as "from the RCLC import" lives in the audit log action name (`'Loot Imported (RCLC)'`), not a data column.
- **Unresolved items are left `item_id = null` and counted, not auto-created.** Auto-creating a placeholder `items` row (matching the historical import's legacy-source behavior) would require `SECURITY DEFINER`, since `items` grants no authenticated role a direct write. Given the season's Item Lookup should already be populated before loot starts flowing, a genuinely unresolved item is a sign that needs updating, not something to paper over -- so the RPC stays `SECURITY INVOKER` instead, matching `add_signup_to_roster()`'s reasoning ("authorization comes from existing RLS") since officers already have full write access to both `players` and `rclc_loot` directly.
- **Player resolution is an exact `name_realm` match (case-insensitive), no diacritic folding**, unlike the Node-side one-time-import registry (`scripts/import/lib/registry.js`), which folds diacritics because sheet data was officer-typed by hand across multiple tabs inconsistently. RCLC reads the name straight from the game client, so it should already match the roster's `name_realm` exactly. Unknown names get an archived stub, same shape as the historical import's stub rows.
- **`awarded_at` combines the export's separate `date` and `time` fields** (assumed America/New_York, matching the site's existing display-timezone assumption for this data), an improvement over the GAS path, which discarded time-of-day entirely.
- **"Import History" moved to Supabase after all, but sourced from `audit_log`, not `rclc_loot` directly, and without a "Clear All" button.** Originally deferred (see below) because `rclc_loot` mixes paste-imports with the separate legacy-tracker rows the #320 historical import already merged in, with no column distinguishing which is which -- querying it directly would misrepresent old history as recent imports, and a "Clear All" could delete real history instead of just recent pastes. Kat wanted the visibility restored once the GAS-sourced version turned up permanently empty in practice (nothing writes to the old "Pasted Loot" sheet anymore). The fix: every successful import already logs one `'Loot Imported (RCLC)'` audit_log entry per row, and -- critically -- only genuine paste-imports ever produce that action, since it's called from nowhere else. Querying `audit_log` for that action (already RLS-scoped to the team via "Officers read audit_log") gives an exactly-accurate recent-imports list with zero schema change, reusing `resolveAuditTargetNames()`/`auditFormatTs()` from the Audit Log tab (#378). "Clear All" is dropped, not rebuilt: there's still no safe way to select only paste-imported rows out of `rclc_loot` for deletion. A properly-scoped season-reset-clearing feature is a future issue if it's ever needed, not something to improvise here.

## 2026-07-09 -- Attendance writes (#218): writes-only, reads deliberately staying on Apps Script for now

Unlike roster (#216) and BiS (#217), attendance's Supabase table doesn't yet have a live pipeline feeding it real data. Checked the live DB before starting:

```
 team_id | count |    max     |    min
---------+-------+------------+------------
       1 |   829 | 2026-06-25 | 2026-03-17
```

Hellfire and Immolation have zero rows. Phoenix's 829 rows are a one-time historical import, frozen at 2026-06-25 -- the pipeline that actually produces new attendance data (`refreshAttendanceWCL` in `gs/Attendance.gs`, run weekly) still writes only to the Google Sheet, and that migration is a separate issue (#223, Phase 7), not done yet.

- **Writes move to Supabase; reads stay on the Apps Script Sheet.** Migrating grid reads now (mirroring #217's BiS precedent) would show an empty grid for any team without the historical import and a stale one for Phoenix, since nothing populates new raid nights in Supabase until #223 ships. `setPlayerStatus`/`toggleReportExcluded` (`js/tabs/tab-attendance.js`) now write to `attendance` via upsert/update, but `getAttendanceGrid` keeps reading the Sheet.
- **A second, separate write path existed and needed the same fix**: `saveAttendanceFromCard()` (`js/common.js`), fired from the player-profile "Attendance" history card rather than the Attendance tab's grid, called the same GAS `setAttendanceStatus` action through its own independent code path -- caught only during manual testing, not by grepping the issue's own scope notes (which only mentioned `tab-attendance.js`). Ported to the identical Supabase upsert + audit log shape as `setPlayerStatus`. Worth remembering for #219/#220: search the whole `js/` tree for a GAS action name before assuming a single call site, since this codebase has more than one UI surface writing to the same table more than once.
- **Accepted interim quirk: an officer's edit is session-only until reads migrate.** Since the grid still reads the untouched Sheet, a page reload shows the Sheet's stale value again -- the edit only persists in Supabase and in the existing local `_attendanceGrid` patch for the rest of that browser session. Confirmed acceptable with Kat: officer attendance workflows aren't moving onto this path in practice until the whole pipeline (including #223) is on Supabase; this PR exists to have the write half ready and waiting, not to be used for real edits yet.
- **`attendance.player_id`'s FK reconciled to `ON DELETE SET NULL`** (migration `20260709170000_attendance_player_id_set_null.sql`), matching `rclc_loot` and the decision #250 already called for but never actually migrated (the baseline dump still showed `ON DELETE CASCADE`). Column made nullable to support it; `check_team_id_matches_player()` already guards on `new.player_id is not null`, so this doesn't need a trigger change. Safety net only -- soft-delete via `archived_at` (#216/#258) is the only path roster removal takes today.
- **Audit action names and shapes carried over unchanged from GAS**: `'Attendance Status Set'` targets the player (`target_type: 'players'`, matching #216/#217's TARGET-durability reasoning), detail `"<old> -> <new>"` (matches the historical backfill's format for this exact action). `'Report Excluded'`/`'Report Exclusion Removed'` have no single player to target (they apply to a whole raid night), so `target_type`/`target_id` are `null` and the raid date goes in the detail string instead.

## 2026-07-09 -- BiS list edits (#217): editor reworked to instant per-row writes; audit entries target the player, not the bis_items row

The old officer BiS editor (`js/tabs/tab-bis.js`) staged add/remove in a local array and pushed the whole list on one "Save" click, because the GAS `setBisItems` handler it called only ever supported rewriting a player's entire BiS column at once. `bis_items` supports true per-row insert/update/delete, and the issue itself flagged the editor's shape as an open design call rather than something to port as-is.

- **Reworked to instant writes, no staged state.** Picking an item, clicking `x`, and toggling the new "Obtained" checkbox each fire their own Supabase write immediately (one `audit_log` row apiece) instead of accumulating in `_bisListEditor.items` for a batched Save. Removes the "did I remember to hit Save" ambiguity the granular backend was meant to fix, and matches the instant-toggle pattern #216 already established for the Roster tab.
- **Audit entries use `target_type: 'players'` / `target_id: <player.id>`, not `'bis_items'` / `<bis_items.id>`.** `resolve_actor_name()`/`resolveAuditTargetNames()` (`tab-audit.js`) only ever resolve a TARGET by looking its primary key up in the live table. A `bis_items` id goes stale the instant "remove" runs (the row is gone), which would permanently blank TARGET for every remove entry and any add/obtain entry for an item later removed. `players.id` never disappears for an active roster member, so pointing at the player keeps TARGET showing the character name for all three actions, indefinitely. The action name and detail string (e.g. `"Chest Firelord's Vestments"`) already carry the item-level specifics; TARGET only needed to answer "which character."
- **BiS reads also moved to Supabase in the same PR**, ahead of what #217 literally scoped (writes only). Roster reads had their own migration issue before #216 shipped roster writes; BiS had no equivalent, so shipping writes-only would have made `DATA.bisList` (sourced from the Apps Script heavy chunk) go stale the moment any write landed -- a reload would show wrong BiS counts/contents everywhere the list is used (roster tab, contested items, profile checklist). `fetchSupabaseBisItems()`/`mapSupabaseBisItems()` (`js/common.js`) replace `heavy.bisList` when the Supabase read succeeds, keyed by the same raw-firstName convention `mapSupabaseRoster()` uses (`tab-conflicts.js`/`tab-priority.js` index `DATA.bisList[firstName]` directly, bypassing the normalised-lookup `getBisItems()` does).
- **Item ids resolved by exact `items.name` match at write time** (`resolveItemId()`), same approach #216 used for `classes_specs` -- no client-side id cache exists yet for either lookup table.

## 2026-07-09 -- Roster edits (#216): Role dropdown dropped, Class+Spec write together

The old Player Settings panel (`js/common.js`) had three independent controls -- Role, Class, Spec -- each firing its own write, matching the old sheet's three separate columns. The migrated `players` table only has `class_spec_id` (a single FK into `classes_specs`, which pairs each class+spec with exactly one `role`); there's no column an independent role write or a class-only write could land on.

- **Role select removed entirely, replaced with a static read-only display of the derived value.** An independent role override doesn't fit the schema -- role always follows from whichever class_spec_id is set, so a selectable Role dropdown could only ever silently disagree with Class/Spec or do nothing.
- **Class and Spec stay as two dropdowns, but only Spec's onchange fires a write.** Picking a new Class only repopulates the Spec dropdown client-side (`officerUpdateClass`); the write (`officerSaveClassSpec` -> `updateClassSpecSupabase` in `js/tabs/tab-roster.js`) fires once a Spec is chosen, reading Class's current DOM value at that point and resolving both to one `classes_specs` row before updating `class_spec_id`. This mirrors the only state that's ever actually valid to write: a complete (class, spec) pair.
- **Audit label reuses `'Spec Changed'`** (not a new `'Class/Spec Changed'` label) since the historical backfill (`20260709140000_backfill_audit_log_detail.sql`) already maps `Spec Changed`/`Class Changed`/`Role Changed` to the same `'Changed to ' || to` summary shape -- one combined write reusing an existing label keeps the Audit Log tab's convention intact without adding a fourth near-duplicate action name.
- **Roster reads now include `players.id`** (`js/common.js` `fetchSupabaseRoster`/`mapSupabaseRoster`) so writes can target a row by primary key instead of `name_realm`, matching the `.eq('id', playerId)` pattern #216 called for.

## 2026-07-09 -- anon/authenticated need USAGE on sequences too, not just table DML

#312 granted base table DML (`select/insert/update/delete` on all `public` tables) to `anon`/`authenticated` so RLS policies would actually get consulted on a write. Found while testing #216's Add Player flow: inserting into `players` still failed with `permission denied for sequence players_id_seq`, even though the row-level `"Officers write players"` policy permits the insert.

- **A serial/identity column's `nextval()` checks `USAGE` on its backing sequence before RLS is ever reached.** #312 only covered tables; nothing had exercised an `INSERT ... DEFAULT` through PostgREST until now, so the gap sat unnoticed. Same class of issue #332 flagged for `service_role` -- this is the `anon`/`authenticated` half of it.
- **Fix mirrors #312's shape exactly:** one additive migration (`20260709150000_sequence_grants.sql`, #383), `grant usage, select on all sequences in schema public to anon, authenticated` plus the matching `alter default privileges` so future sequences pick it up automatically. Doesn't loosen anything -- RLS still gates every row.
- **No dbdoc/RLS.md update needed** -- grants don't appear in either (confirmed against #312's precedent), so this is a schema-docs-CI no-op.

## 2026-07-09 -- Historical audit_log.detail backfilled in place, legacy changed_by dropped rather than preserved

The Stage C import (#320) wrote the raw `{target, from, to, changed_by}` shape into `audit_log.detail` for every historical row; `write_audit_log()` (#214) and the Audit Log tab rewire (#378) both expect a single human-readable summary string instead. Migration `20260709140000_backfill_audit_log_detail.sql` (#377, split from #215) converts existing rows in place via `UPDATE ... WHERE jsonb_typeof(detail) = 'object'`.

- **One-time SQL backfill over fixing the importer and re-importing.** `scripts/import/tables/audit.js` doesn't need to change -- its own idempotency guard (`NOT EXISTS` on `(team_id, created_at, action)`) has nothing to do with this conversion, and a wipe-and-reimport would touch production data via delete+reinsert for no benefit over an in-place `UPDATE`.
- **Rerun-safe by construction, not by a migration-tracking table.** The `jsonb_typeof(detail) = 'object'` scope means a row already converted to a plain string is left alone on a second run, and any future write through `write_audit_log()` that happens to pass a jsonb object as `p_detail` would also need this same guard kept in mind if this migration ever needs to be edited.
- **Legacy `detail.changed_by` (a free-text Discord username, not an `auth.users` link) is dropped, not preserved.** Every historical row already has `actor_id = null` and always will (the sheet's Changed By was never an account link) -- these rows were never going to resolve a CHANGED BY through `resolve_actor_name()` (#376) regardless of what happens to `detail`, so keeping `changed_by` around in some structured form would only complicate the tab (#378) for a display gap that already existed. Confirmed with Kat rather than assumed.
- **Two corrections to the conversion map** as originally proposed in #215's comments, found by reconciling against the real distinct-action list in production (not just the `gs/wgaWebApp.gs` call sites): `Trial Status Changed`/`Bench Status Changed` store `to`/`from` as the literal strings `"TRUE"`/`"FALSE"`, not booleans; `Officer Granted`/`Officer Revoked`'s `to` is a raw Discord snowflake id, not human-readable, so both were moved from "use TO directly" into the empty-detail bucket -- TARGET (the username) already carries the meaningful part.

## 2026-07-09 -- Actor-name resolution reads auth.users PII, so it's gated like a read policy, not just an execute grant

`resolve_actor_name(p_actor_id uuid, p_team_id integer)` (migration `20260709130000_resolve_actor_name.sql`, #376, split from #215) resolves `audit_log.actor_id` to a display name for the Audit Log tab's CHANGED BY column.

- **Internal authorization check, not just a GRANT restriction.** Every other SECURITY DEFINER function so far (`write_audit_log`, `claim_character`) only ever exposes or attributes the _caller's own_ data. This one is different: its Discord-display-name fallback path reads `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data` for an arbitrary other person (the case where a site admin acted on a team they don't belong to, so no `team_members` row exists to resolve a name from). Restricting `EXECUTE` to `authenticated` alone would let any raider harvest other people's Discord display names by probing actor uuids across teams they have nothing to do with. The function therefore re-checks the same `my_team_role(p_team_id) in ('officer','team_leader') or is_site_admin()` gate `"Officers read audit_log"` already enforces at the table level -- callers who couldn't read a team's audit log can't resolve names on it either.
- **Resolution order mirrors `resolveDiscordSession()`'s existing client-side priority** (`js/discord.js`): linked player's `nickname`, then the character-name part of `name_realm` (preferring the linked `players` row over `team_members.name_realm`'s legacy bridge column, same precedence `resolveDiscordSession()` uses), then the Discord display name, then `null`.

## 2026-07-09 -- Audit log write path: security-definer writer is the only insert path

`audit_log` grants anon/authenticated only `REFERENCES,TRIGGER,TRUNCATE,MAINTAIN` -- no `INSERT` -- so a Phase 5 officer write feature has no direct path to log an action. `write_audit_log(p_team_id, p_action, p_target_type, p_target_id, p_detail)` (migration `20260709120000_write_audit_log.sql`) is the one function meant to ever insert into that table.

- **Same SECURITY DEFINER shape as `is_site_admin()`, `link_auth_user_to_member()`, `claim_character()`:** `plpgsql`, `set search_path to 'public'`, identity read directly from `auth.uid()` rather than a passed-in parameter, so a caller can't attribute an action to someone else.
- **`actor_id` is always `auth.uid()`**, never a caller-supplied value -- matches the column's FK to `auth.users` and keeps attribution trustworthy regardless of what the caller passes as arguments.
- **Gate is officer/team_leader-or-site-admin**, via `my_team_role(p_team_id) in ('officer', 'team_leader')` or `is_site_admin()` -- the same pair every other officer-tier policy in this schema checks (post-#294 rename; the value is no longer `admin`).
- **Every future Phase 5 officer-write RPC should follow this same shape** (security definer, `auth.uid()`-derived actor, officer/team_leader-or-site-admin gate) instead of re-deciding the pattern per call site. Wiring existing write flows (roster edits, BiS approvals, loot marks, still on the legacy Apps Script backend) onto this function is out of scope for #214 and left for those flows' own migration issues.

## 2026-07-08 -- Loot attributes to characters; unknown loot names become archived stubs

The loot importer previously kept rows whose player name no longer matched the Roster with `player_id` null (67 of phoenix's 156 imported rows, spanning 24 departed characters). Any player-keyed view drops such rows, and the Supabase loot read (#209) is player-keyed, so those rows would have vanished from the site's loot totals and Recent Loot feed.

- **Unknown loot names now become archived stubs**, through the same `registry.resolveOrStub` path attendance and scoring always used: a departed character gets a `players` row with `archived_at` set and no class/spec, and the loot row points at it. A one-time relink script backfilled the pre-stub prod rows (stub inserts, then `player_id` updates keyed on `dedupe_key`, which embeds the normalized name-realm).
- **Layering principle:** `players` rows are characters; `team_members` is the person (Discord) layer; `players.team_member_id` links them, many characters to one person. Loot attribution stays character-level -- the historical fact of who the item dropped to. Person-level grouping (mainswaps, alts, same-name characters played by one human) is a `team_member_id` linking exercise through the claims flow and officer tooling, never a loot-schema change.
- The Snarge precedent holds: two characters sharing a first name stay two rows; whether one human plays both is person-layer information.

## 2026-07-07 -- Loot columns store item track, named and valued as track (Champion/Hero/Myth)

The `difficulty` columns on `rclc_loot`, `self_received_requests`, and `priority_order` were renamed to `track` with values `Champion`/`Hero`/`Myth` (migration `20260707221243_track_vocabulary`).

- **The semantic was always the item's upgrade track, not the raid difficulty.** The GAS app translated Normal-difficulty drops to "champion", and `self_received_requests` uses the same values for M+ vault, crafted, and catalyst items that never dropped at any raid difficulty. The #320 B2 decision kept "Heroic"/"Mythic" as convenience labels ("lines up with the instance difficulty made it easier"); #343 finished the thought by adopting the real track names, and kat confirmed the column "was only called difficulty because of it being derived from the Instance column."
- **RCLC input maps deterministically for raid drops** (Normal -> Champion, Heroic -> Hero, Mythic -> Myth, from the instance string's suffix). The RCLC itemString's bonus IDs encode the track authoritatively and are the preferred source for the Phase 5 ongoing import (#219).
- **`priority_order` allows only Hero/Myth, permanently.** Champion loot drops in the first weeks of a raid and is handed out by loot council (via RCLC's roll column), never through the priority system.

## 2026-07-06 -- Pending roster is a season_signups state, not a players flag

The old sheet's "Pending Roster" tab (approved applicants waiting for the roster add) needed a database home. The candidate designs were a marker column on `players` (`is_pending boolean` or `rostered_at timestamptz`, with the player row created at approve time) versus keeping the whole staging phase inside `season_signups`.

- **Chosen: no `players` row until the roster add.** Pending roster is exactly `season_signups` with `status = 'approved'` and `approved_player_id IS NULL`. The UI reads it through the `pending_roster` view (`security_invoker = on`, so the officer-only `season_signups` policies apply to callers). Promotion is `add_signup_to_roster(signup_id, is_trial, archive_player_id)`, a `SECURITY INVOKER` function that creates or unarchives the player, optionally archives a main-swap predecessor, and flips the signup to `added` in one transaction. A one-directional CHECK (`season_signups_player_only_when_added`) guarantees only `added` rows link to a player, while still tolerating the FK's `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
- **Promotion upsert has three cases** on `(team_id, name_realm)`: new character (plain insert, trial by default, `join_date = current_date`); returning archived character (unarchive the old row, refresh spec/trial/join_date, keep the same `players.id` so loot and attendance history stays attached); already-active member (link and update spec only, preserving their existing `is_trial` and `join_date`).
- **Rejected: marker column on `players`.** Four reasons. (1) `players` is public-read (`USING (true)`), so approve-time creation leaks applicant names to anonymous API callers unless the public policy is rewritten and every existing row backfilled; signup data is officer-only today. (2) It duplicates state `season_signups.status` already holds, and Postgres cannot enforce a cross-table invariant without trigger sync between two officer-writable tables, so the copies drift. (3) A pending player row can silently acquire attendance/loot/scoring rows through the name-matching importers. (4) A returning character's archived row collides with `UNIQUE (team_id, name_realm)` at approve time, and dismissing a pending player has no good answer (hard-delete contradicts #258's soft-delete, archiving pollutes history with characters that never raided). Deferring creation makes all of these unrepresentable.

## 2026-07-05 -- Schema documentation: generated with tbls, not hand-drawn

Triggered by losing a hand-arranged Supabase schema visualizer layout: the visualizer stores table positions in browser localStorage, per device, so it can never serve as documentation.

- **Generated over hand-drawn.** A hand-drawn diagram drifts from the migrations, and a stale diagram is worse than none. The migration SQL is already the source of truth, so the diagram is generated from it: `tbls` introspects the local stack and writes `dbdoc/` (markdown plus Mermaid ER), and a CI job fails any PR where `dbdoc/` no longer matches the schema. Regenerate with `npm run db:docs`.
- **Mermaid over SVG.** Renders natively on GitHub and diffs as text, so schema changes show up readably in PR review. SVG lays out prettier but commits unreviewable blobs.
- **RLS documented by hand.** tbls introspects structure, not policies, so `docs/RLS.md` carries the per-table policy matrix, with its own CI guard: a PR touching policy SQL must touch RLS.md.
- **Rejected: Supabase visualizer as documentation** (device-local localStorage) and **dbdiagram.io as source of truth** (canvas lives in their cloud; same one-browser trap, plus a second schema definition to keep aligned).

## #250 -- Schema audit: Phase 1 review

- **Seasons table.** Adding a `seasons` lookup table (`slug` PK, `name`, `starts_at`, `ends_at`) instead of a format CHECK on `season text` columns. A CHECK can't catch a well-formed typo (`MN11` vs `MN1`); only an FK against a canonical table can. `ends_at IS NULL` also gives "current season" for free, which the priority generator and #143 (archived seasons) both need.
- **team_settings / season_snapshots SELECT policy.** Locked down to team members only (`my_team_role(team_id) is not null`). Both tables carry data with no reason to be publicly readable, unlike roster/loot which the public site intentionally exposes.
- **attendance FK on-delete.** Changed `attendance.player_id` to `ON DELETE SET NULL` (was `CASCADE`), matching `rclc_loot`. Soft-delete (`players.archived_at`, decided in #258) is the primary path; this FK change is the safety net if a hard-delete ever happens anyway.
- **Auth-link backfill.** Added an `AFTER INSERT` trigger on `team_members` and `site_admins` that backfills `auth_user_id` immediately if the person already has an `auth.users` row (covers the case where someone logs in via Discord before an officer seeds their row).

## #257 -- Schema hardening (constraints, timestamps, triggers)

Umbrella issue. Original scope, later split into #262 (nullability/duplicate guards), #266 (updated_at), #267 (team_id consistency trigger):

- Unique constraints: `attendance(team_id, player_id, raid_date)`, `bis_items(player_id, item_id)`, `priority_order(team_id, season, item_id, difficulty, player_id)`, `priority_order(team_id, season, item_id, difficulty, rank)`, `item_bosses(item_id, boss)`, `classes_specs(class, spec)`, `teams.slug`.
- CHECK constraints on status/enum-like columns across `season_signups`, `attendance`, `self_received_requests`, `bis_requests`, `mplus_exclusion_requests`, `rclc_loot.difficulty`, `priority_order.difficulty`, `classes_specs.role`, `items.armor_type`.
- **Original updated_at table list:** `players`, `bis_items`, `priority_order`, `team_members`, `team_settings`, `season_signups`. (Note: this list drifted when #266 was spun out -- see that entry and #272.)
- **Original team_id trigger table list:** `attendance`, `rclc_loot`, `self_received_requests`, `bis_requests`, `mplus_exclusion_requests`, `priority_order` (six tables -- see #267/#271 for how `priority_order` got dropped along the way).

## #258 -- Scoring, WCL data, and identity design decisions

- **scoring table:** add `season text NOT NULL`, unique key becomes `(player_id, season)`. Additive per season instead of overwritten, for trend analysis and priority generation.
- **player_wcl_season_perf (new table):** separate from `scoring` -- different source (WCL character API vs. team reports), different update cadence (once per season vs. per raid import). Holds `best_perf_avg` / `median_perf_avg` fetched at season start, used as the heroic priority baseline until current-season `scoring` data accumulates.
- **Identity/lifecycle fix:** `players.team_member_id` (FK -> `team_members.id`, nullable) links a character row to the person/Discord account. `players.archived_at` (soft-delete) preserves character history across a main-swap instead of losing it to a hard-delete. `season_signups.approved_player_id` (FK -> `players.id`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`) links a signup to the character it produced.
- **Season-scoping of wipe-between-seasons tables:** `scoring` gets a `season` column (preserve history). `mplus_exclusion_requests` and `bis_items` do NOT -- both wipe between seasons on purpose (gear/tier resets the exclusion criteria and BiS lists are rebuilt fresh each tier), and that intent is written down here so it isn't mistaken for a bug later.

## #262 -- Nullability + duplicate-guard hardening

- `bis_items.item_id` and `mplus_exclusion_requests.player_id` set `NOT NULL` (both tables empty at the time, no backfill cost).
- `mplus_excl_one_pending_per_player` partial unique index (`(player_id) where status = 'pending'`) replaces the dropped `(player_id, week_of)` constraint -- one open request per player, resolved rows stay as history.
- **priority_order rank-reorder safety -- Option B (delete + reinsert).** The `(team_id, season, item_id, difficulty, rank)` unique constraint fails mid-statement on bulk re-rank updates (Postgres checks row-by-row). Decided to have the app delete + reinsert the full list per reorder, rather than making the constraint `DEFERRABLE`. **Scope note:** this decision applies only to the reorder app logic, which doesn't exist yet (the priority list feature is still GAS/Sheets-based) -- it does NOT apply to schema/trigger work on `priority_order`, which should proceed independent of when the reorder UI gets built. See [[project_priority_order_migration]] in memory and #271 for why this distinction matters.

## #266 -- updated_at timestamps

- Added `updated_at timestamptz` + shared `set_updated_at()` BEFORE UPDATE trigger to six tables: `players`, `season_signups`, `bis_items`, `scoring`, `mplus_exclusion_requests`, `priority_order`.
- **Nullable, no default.** A freshly inserted row has `updated_at = NULL` until its first real update. None of these tables (aside from `season_signups`, which has `submitted_at`) have a separate created-at column, so leaving `updated_at` null at insert is what lets you tell "never edited since creation" apart from "edited at time X." (The original #266 write-up justified this as "no backfill needed," which isn't accurate -- `NOT NULL DEFAULT now()` backfills for free on `ADD COLUMN` -- the real reason is the one above; corrected in #272.)
- **Table list note:** this six-table list does not match #257's original list (`team_members` and `team_settings` were dropped, `scoring` and `mplus_exclusion_requests` were added). No comment anywhere explains the swap -- see #272, where the omission of `team_members`/`team_settings` was confirmed as unintentional and fixed.

## #267 -- team_id consistency trigger

- Added `check_team_id_matches_player()` (BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE) to five tables: `attendance`, `rclc_loot`, `bis_requests`, `self_received_requests`, `mplus_exclusion_requests`. Raises if the row's `team_id` doesn't match `players.team_id` for the given `player_id`; skips the check when `player_id` is null (allowed on `rclc_loot` after a player delete).
- `bis_items` intentionally excluded -- no denormalized `team_id`, derives team through the `player_id` FK by design.
- **`priority_order` was left off this list** despite being named in #257's original six-table scope. Confirmed a plain implementation oversight, not a deliberate exclusion -- fixed in #271.

## #271 -- priority_order missing team_id consistency trigger

- Added `check_team_id_matches_player()` trigger to `priority_order` (table was empty, no backfill concern), bringing it in line with the other five tables from #267.

## #272 -- updated_at coverage + nullable/default revisit

- **Coverage:** add `updated_at` + `set_updated_at()` trigger to `team_members` and `team_settings` too, matching #257's original scope. Both are clearly mutable (`role` changes, `auth_user_id` backfill, `name_realm` swaps on `team_members`; officer-edited `config` on `team_settings`) with no existing timestamp column, and no reason for the #266 omission was ever recorded.
- **Nullable/default:** confirmed keep nullable, no `DEFAULT now()` -- see the corrected rationale under #266 above.

## #283 -- Roster "Priority" column's RL/Officer values are legacy, no migration needed

- The GAS Roster sheet's `Priority` column is documented as `1=RL, 2=Officer, 3=Tank, 4=Heal, 5=DPS, 6=Bench`, but every write path (`roleToPriority()`) only ever produces `3`/`4`/`5`/`6` -- nothing in the app has ever written `1` or `2`. Officer status is tracked entirely separately (Discord ID list today, `team_members.role` in the new schema).
- Confirmed with Kat: "RL" was never a distinct app concept, just a manual Sheet-only sort aid; a raid leader is almost always (not by rule) also an officer, and no dashboard permission or display logic has ever depended on it.
- **Decision:** no RL concept needs a home anywhere in the new schema. The already-migrated `players` table correctly has no equivalent column (role derives from `class_spec_id`, bench is its own `is_bench` boolean). Any leftover `1`/`2` in a live Sheet row is dead data with nothing to carry over.
- This also closes out this specific instance of the migration plan's open "does any officer hand-edit the Sheet in a way the dashboard can't do?" question -- no gap found.

## #294 -- Permission tier names: raider / officer / team_leader, plus site_admin

- The word "admin" meant two unrelated things: the top per-team role in `team_members.role`, and the global `site_admins` table. No doc defined the difference, and `docs/supabase-setup-guide.md` lumped officer and admin into one tier even though three write policies separate them (`team_settings`, `team_members`, `season_snapshots`).
- **Decision:** the stored per-team role value `admin` is renamed to `team_leader`; the global tier is always written `site_admin`. Bare "admin" appears nowhere in docs or UI copy. The rename shipped as a migration that updates the stored values, the CHECK constraint, and all 20 policies that referenced the old literal (the three "Admins write ..." policies are now "Team leaders write ...").
- Live data confirmed the tier is load-bearing before renaming: each team has exactly one `team_leader` row, and two of the three are NOT site admins, so the role cannot be replaced by `site_admins` without over-granting.
- The UI will honor the officer/team-leader split when the frontend moves to Supabase; that scope (which Admin-tab panels tighten, which stay officer-level) is recorded in #317.
